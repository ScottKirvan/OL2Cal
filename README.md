sk One-Liner Parser


# TODO

- [x] add command line parser  
- [ ] error reporting  
- [x] open specified filename rather than hardcoded one  
- [ ] optionally write to file, insted of stdout [default]  
- [ ] change assumed hrs in day  
- [ ] use pattern matching / rules specified in a config file  - the problem is the changes required to parse certain filetypes - I'm thinking this might be abstractable to a certain degree
- [ ] default config file location?  
- [ ] handle output to file as well as stdout
